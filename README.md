# Window Title Hider

## What is this
A webextension that hides the browser window title on the task bar (shows a text/prefix first). It shows a pre-set text as a prefix, but is also possible to change it to a custom one in the options section.

Due to limitations in WebExtensions' API is not possible to remove the full title on just the window title, hence the reason to use a prefix.

## How to install
It is available for Firefox on AMO: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/window-title-hider/
